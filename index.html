<h2>About me</h2>

<img class=resright src="foto_perfil.jpg" alt="My face">
<p>I'm doing a PhD at the <a href="https://www.icmat.es/">Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas</a> (Madrid), under the supervision of Prof. Manuel de León. My area of research is geometric mechanics. More specifically, my PhD thesis is about the geometrical aspects of dynamical systems with dissipation. I currently hold a predoctoral researcher position (PRE2020-093814) from the Spanish Research Council (<a href="https://www.csic.es/en">CSIC</a>).
</p>

<p>I'm a PhD candidate in Mathematics at the Autonomous University of Madrid. I previously obtained a BSc in Physics at the Complutense University of Madrid and a MSc in Theoretical Physics at the Autonomous University of Madrid. Even though I studied physics, I've always liked pure mathematics as well, so I decided to become a mathematical physicist. I'm specially interested in the mathematical foundations of the physical theories and, conversely, the physical motivation for developments in mathematics.</p>

<p>I’m member of the Royal Spanish Mathematical Society (RSME) and the Spanish Royal Physics Society (RSEF).</p>
